## Midterm Report
- Question 1
    - Analysis 1
        - In this part, I use data in folder 'enron/maildir/skilling-j/sent' to find out who are Skilling most frequently sent email to. Result is wrote into a csv file. However, It's surprising that he has a very little contact list. Maybe it's because of the dataset has been filtered. 
    - Analysis 2
        - In this part, I use data in '/enron/maildir/*/sent_items/' to clean up date of emails sent and count the numbers of each date. Output(date, fequency) is wrote into a csv file and shows the fequency descendingly.
    - Analysis 3
        - In this part, I use data in '/enron/maildir/*/sent_items/' to find top 50 words used frequently in emails without stop words.
