data Analysis Using Python 
### Feedback:
- Question 1: Need to sort by the value and get the top 10
- Question 4: Need to consider the same user in different date file as one user. 
- Question 5: You may want to compare the whole list instead of the top 50 result to get the correct answer. 
- Question 8: You may want to consider the lowercase problem and User name should be removed as well.
